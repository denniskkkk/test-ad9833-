 * This sketch demonstrates the use of the AD9833 DDS module library.
 * 
 * If you don't have an oscilloscope or spectrum analyzer, I don't quite know how you will
 * verify correct operation for some of the functions.
 * TODO: Add tests where the Arduino itself vereifies AD9833 basic operation.  Frequency of
 * square wave, sine/triangular wave using the A/D inputs (would need a level shifter).
